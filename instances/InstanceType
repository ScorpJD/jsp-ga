Small Instances
All instances have 3 jobs are characterized by the number of machines (m), the
maximum number of tasks per job (vmax ) and the range of processing times (pi ).
A set of instances was generated combining three values of each parameter: m = 3, 5, 7;
vmax = 5, 7, 10 and pi = [1, 10], [1, 50], [1, 100]. In all cases, 10 instances
were considered from each combination. The sets of instances are identified by the tuple: < m_vmax _pi >.

Large Instances
All instances have 3 jobs and 3 machines are characterized the maximum number of tasks 
per job (vmax ) and the range of processing times (pi ).
A set of instances was generated combining three values of each parameter: 
vmax = 20, 25, 30 and pi = [1, 50], [1, 100], [1, 200]. In all cases, 10 instances
were considered from each combination. The sets of instances are identified by the tuple: < m_vmax _pi >.
